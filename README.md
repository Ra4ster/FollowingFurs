### 💬 QnA
- Q: Do you follow all furries, including NSFW and political furries?
A: We try to follow all furries that make the account safe for *everyone*, so accounts posting dangerous content for minors will be passed on.
- Q: So you only interact with straight arrows?
A: We may interact with anyone's content so long as it is safe. We will try not to interact with extremists, active criminals, and P*dophiles/Zoos whenever possible. This is our only exception.
- Q: Can I help at all?
A: We have multiple people looking at DMs, and that is a great place to report activity on our account you disliked, or to notify us of an account we followed by mistake.
Additionally, we have applications open on occasion to [join staff here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSemAI2pC4wL9bIThOSdgxcgSc0j8jSdiB88PuQjB8XMlyExYA/viewform?pli=1).
